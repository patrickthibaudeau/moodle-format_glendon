# Glendon Course Format

# NO MORE SUPPORT FOR VERSIONS BELOW MOODLE 3.7. 
Because this plugin requires a theme based on boost and will not work with themes based on bootstrapbase, and that Moodle 3.7 will not have support for themes based on bootstrapbase, I will only maintain a version of this plugin for Moodle 3.7+ moving forward. This also means that I have deleted the branches for earlier versions of the plugin.
## Description
The Glendon course format visually enhances your Moodle course by breaking sections into a grid format. Adding an image and text within the section description will format the grid with the image and the text. When you click into the section, your course content will be displayed in a tabbed layout, making it easy and clear for your students to navigate your course. This also standardizes the look and feel for your courses.


> ***Note that this course format only works with themes based on Boost***

## Installation
The Glendon course format is dependent on the atto_etitle plugin that must be installed before installing the course format.  To install, unzip the glendon.zip file into the course/format/ folder.
## Using Glendon course format
### 1. Edit settings
- In your course, click on the cog at the top right of your course and then click on Edit settings
- Scroll down to the Course format section and expand to view the options
- Change the Format by clicking intho the menu and select Glendon format. Your browser will refresh and you will have options for the format.
- - Number of columns: Sections will become grid items, This option allows you to select how many grid items you want per row. The default is 3.
- - Top section collapsed: Section 0 or General becomes accordion content. This option either has the content closed or open when you enter the course.

*note: Adding a course summary file will display the image above the 0 section. Only one image will display.*

### 2. Editing your course content
It is important to understand that a section will not show up in the grid if there is no content in the section or if the section is hidden. 
#### Turn editing on
You will notice that when you enter your course there is no content available except the "Start here" accordion. You also do not have the default linear sections as with other Moodle course formats. Turning editing on will change the layout to the default "Topics format" look.
#### Edit section
You can edit your section to add a custom title, a description and an image. Only use one image as all other images will be ignored. Only the first image is used. Ideally, you want to make your images a minimum width of 400px
#### Creating tabs
When not editing, the front page will have all sections with content displayed in a grid. However, when you enter the section, the content is then displayed in tabs. If there are no tabs, no content will be displayed. Creating a tab is as simle as adding a label and selecting the "Tab" style from the Paragraph styles in the Atto editor. Any content under the "tab" label will be the content for that tab. You can repeat the step to add a second, third etc tabs.
- Click Add an activity or resource
- Scroll down and select Label
- Enter the title you want for your tab.
- Select the text and then click on the Paragraph styles option (i icon) in the editor and select "Tab" from the menu list
- Save your changes
- Add activities and resources as required for this "section"
- Repeat these steps to add more tabs.
